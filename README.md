# The International Proletariat's Digital Archive

## Mission Statement

The International Proletariat's Digital Archive is committed to making core socialist literature accessible for international struggle. Our mission is to collect, translate, annotate, and disseminate revolutionary theory to educate workers and advance the cause of socialism worldwide.

This archive serves as a central hub for the movement's key texts, fostering collaborative review and debate to refine theoretical understanding. We believe that the mass strike—the spontaneous, political action of the working class—remains the most effective weapon for socialist revolution, and we seek to make the foundational writings on this and other critical concepts available to all.

## Inaugural Project: "The Mass Strike"

Our first project is the collaborative translation and annotation of Rosa Luxemburg's pivotal 1906 pamphlet, **"The Mass Strike, the Political Parties and the Trade Unions."** This text analyzes the 1905 Russian Revolution and argues for the revolutionary potential of spontaneous mass action beyond the narrow confines of trade‑union economism.

Through open collaboration, we aim to produce an accurate, annotated English edition that clarifies historical context and theoretical significance, equipping a new generation of revolutionaries with the tools for the coming struggles.
